# 🚀 SuperIntendent - Quick Build Guide

## ⚠️ MOST IMPORTANT: Directory Location

Your project structure:
```
/superintendent/
├── backend/           ← Backend API (Python)
└── frontend/          ← Mobile App (React Native) **BUILD FROM HERE!**
    ├── package.json   ← Required for build
    ├── app.json       ← App configuration
    └── eas.json       ← Build settings
```

## ✅ Correct Build Commands

**Always run from `/frontend` directory:**

```bash
# Navigate to frontend first
cd frontend

# Then build
eas build -p android --profile preview
```

## ❌ Wrong (Will Fail)

```bash
# DON'T run from root directory
cd superintendent
eas build -p android --profile preview  # ❌ FAILS - No package.json here!
```

## 📝 Complete Build Steps

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt on your PC**

2. **Navigate to frontend folder:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/superintendent/frontend
   ```

3. **Login to Expo:**
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```

4. **Build APK:**
   ```bash
   eas build -p android --profile preview
   ```

5. **Wait 10-15 minutes** - EAS will give you a download link

6. **Download APK to your phone** and install

## 🔍 Verify You're in the Right Place

Before building, check if you're in the correct directory:

```bash
# Should show package.json, app.json, eas.json
ls

# If you see these files, you're good to go! ✅
```

## 💡 Quick Troubleshooting

**Error: "No package.json found"**
- You're in the wrong directory
- Solution: `cd frontend` first

**Error: "React version mismatch"**
- Already fixed! ✅
- Both react and react-dom are at 19.1.0

**Error: "Not logged in"**
- Solution: `eas login`

## 📱 After Build Success

1. Download the APK from the link EAS provides
2. Transfer to your Android phone
3. Install (enable "Install from unknown sources" if needed)
4. Grant permissions when app asks
5. Enjoy your AI OS! 🎉
